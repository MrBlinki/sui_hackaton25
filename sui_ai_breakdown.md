## 1. **Core Features Breakdown**

### A. **Main Page: Listen to Currently Playing Track**
- **Frontend**: This is mostly a UI/web app concern, but you’ll need to fetch the current track info from the blockchain.
- **Backend/Smart Contract**: Store and update the “currently playing” track on-chain.

### B. **Pay SUI to Queue/Choose Next Track**
- **Smart Contract**: Accept SUI payments, manage a queue of tracks, and update the queue when someone pays.
- **Payment Logic**: When a user pays, a portion goes to the artist.

### C. **Artists Upload Music**
- **Smart Contract**: Register new tracks, associate them with artist addresses.
- **Storage**: Store music files on [Walrus](https://walrus.audio/) (off-chain), and store the file reference (e.g., a URL or CID) on-chain.

### D. **Music Storage on Walrus**
- **Off-chain**: Artists upload music to Walrus, get a reference (URL/CID).
- **On-chain**: Store this reference in the track’s metadata.

### E. **Revenue Sharing**
- **Smart Contract**: When a track is played (paid for), split the payment between the artist and (optionally) the platform.

## 2. **Sui Move Concepts & Modules to Use**

- **Custom Types**: For representing tracks, artists, and the queue.
- **Events**: For tracking payments, plays, and uploads.
- **Coin Transfers**: For handling SUI payments.
- **Object Ownership**: For associating tracks with artists.
- **Programmable Transaction Blocks**: For batching actions (e.g., pay + queue track).
- **Kiosk (optional)**: If you want to allow trading of music NFTs or enforce royalties.

## 3. **Suggested Module Structure**

### a. **Track Module**
- Struct: `Track { id, artist, walrus_ref, title, price }`
- Functions: `register_track`, `get_track_info`

### b. **Artist Module**
- Struct: `Artist { address, tracks[] }`
- Functions: `register_artist`, `add_track`

### c. **Jukebox Module**
- Struct: `Jukebox { queue[], current_track }`
- Functions: `queue_track`, `play_next`, `get_current_track`

### d. **Payment Module**
- Function: `pay_for_track` (handles SUI transfer, splits payment)

## 4. **How to Start Development**

### Step 1: **Set Up Your Sui Move Project**
- Follow the [Sui Move Intro Course: Environment Setup](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/894ff6e8fcf1e44d0e5fede6be8a83bdd359185f/unit-one/lessons/1_set_up_environment.md).

### Step 2: **Define Your Custom Types**
- Learn about [Custom Types and Abilities](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/894ff6e8fcf1e44d0e5fede6be8a83bdd359185f/unit-one/lessons/3_custom_types_and_abilities.md).

### Step 3: **Implement Track Registration**
- Store track metadata and Walrus reference on-chain.

### Step 4: **Implement Payment Logic**
- Use [Coin Resource and create_currency](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/894ff6e8fcf1e44d0e5fede6be8a83bdd359185f/unit-three/lessons/4_the_coin_resource_and_create_currency.md) for SUI payments.

### Step 5: **Implement Queue and Play Logic**
- Use Sui objects and collections to manage the queue.

### Step 6: **Frontend Integration**
- Use Sui’s [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/typescript) to interact with your contracts.

## 6. **Next Steps**

1. **Set up your dev environment and create a new Move package.**
2. **Define your main structs (`Track`, `Artist`, `Jukebox`).**
3. **Implement registration and payment logic.**
4. **Test locally, then deploy to testnet.**
5. **Build a simple frontend to interact with your contract.**

# Beginner way

As beginners and for a hackathon, **implementing everything in a single `Jukebox` module is a great idea**! This will keep your code simple, easier to manage, and faster to build. You can always refactor into multiple modules later if needed.

---

## How to Structure a Single `Jukebox` Module

Here’s how you can combine all your logic into one module:

### 1. **Define Your Main Structs**
- `Track`: Stores info about each song (artist, Walrus ref, price, etc.)
- `Jukebox`: Stores the queue, current track, and maybe a list of all tracks.

### 2. **Key Functions in the Module**
- `register_track`: Artists call this to add a new song.
- `queue_track`: Listeners call this, pay SUI, and add a track to the queue.
- `play_next`: Advances to the next track in the queue.
- `get_current_track`: Returns info about the currently playing track.
- `pay_artist`: Handles payment splitting when a track is queued.

### 3. **Example Skeleton (Pseudocode, not real Move code)**
> **Note:** I can only provide code that is present in your context. If you want a real code example, let me know and I’ll search for a relevant Move example for you.

```move
module Jukebox {
    struct Track { /* artist, walrus_ref, price, etc. */ }
    struct Jukebox { /* queue, current_track, tracks */ }

    public fun register_track(...) { /* ... */ }
    public fun queue_track(...) { /* ... */ }
    public fun play_next(...) { /* ... */ }
    public fun get_current_track(...) { /* ... */ }
    public fun pay_artist(...) { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Why This Works for a Hackathon

- **Faster to Build:** Less boilerplate, fewer files.
- **Easier to Debug:** All logic in one place.
- **Beginner Friendly:** You don’t need to worry about cross-module imports or complex dependencies.

---

## Next Steps

- Start by defining your `Track` and `Jukebox` structs.
- Implement the `register_track` and `queue_track` functions first.
- Add payment logic using SUI coins.
- Test each function as you go.
